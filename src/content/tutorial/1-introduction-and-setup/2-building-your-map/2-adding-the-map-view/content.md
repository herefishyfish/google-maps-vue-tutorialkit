# Adding the Map View

Now that you have registered the Google Maps view, you can add it to your application. Open the `Home.vue` and add the `MapView` component to the template section.

```vue
  <MapView />
```

This will add a basic map view to your application. You can customize the map view by adding properties and event listeners as needed.
