# All Done!

Well done - you've made it through the tutorial! You now know how to put the Google Maps plugin to work in your app.

Feel free to wander through the rest of the docs, and if you ever run into trouble (or just want to chat), hop on our [Discord](https://nativescript.org/discord). We have a great community of developers who are always willing to help out.

Big shout-out to [@triniwiz](https://github.com/triniwiz) for building and maintaining this plugin - he's poured a ton of effort into it. If you're enjoying what he's created, please consider showing him some support!
